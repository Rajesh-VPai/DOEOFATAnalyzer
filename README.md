# DOEOFATAnalyzer
DOE OFATAnalyzer is a simple One-Factor-At-A-Time (OFAT) Analysing software. It takes the DOE Matrix and the Level Mapping File as inputs and creates the ExtractStrengthMode data structure. This data structure is arranged columnwise (Factorwise) versus the Levels of each Factor. It then computes the mean, variance and Signal to noise ratios and displays it for each Output Variable being studied in the DOE Matrix(Result Number).
